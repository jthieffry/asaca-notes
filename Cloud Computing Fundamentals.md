# Key Points

## What is Cloud Computing

* A system is a clodu computing if it has at least those 5 characteristics:
* On-demand self-service: provision and terminate using UI/CLI without human interaction.
* Broad Network Access: access services over any networks, on any devices, using standard protocols and methods.
* Resource pooling: economies of scale, cheaper service.
* Rapid elasticity: scale up (out) and down (in) automatically in response to system load.
* Measured service: usage is measured. Pay for what you consume.
