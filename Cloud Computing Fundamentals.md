# Key Points

## What is Cloud Computing

* A system is a clodu computing if it has at least those 5 characteristics:
* On-demand self-service: provision and terminate using UI/CLI without human interaction.
* Broad Network Access: access services over any networks, on any devices, using standard protocols and methods.
* Resource pooling: economies of scale, cheaper service.
* Rapid elasticity: scale up (out) and down (in) automatically in response to system load.
* Measured service: usage is measured. Pay for what you consume.

## Public vs. Private vs. Hybrid Cloud vs. Multi Cloud

* Public Cloud: using 1 public cloud (ex. AWS, GCP, Azure)
* Private Cloud: using on-prems *real* cloud (it needs to satisfy the 5 points of Cloud Computing. Ex: AWS Outposts)
* Multi-cloud: using more than 1 public cloud (best way: you put one part of your infra in one, the other on one another. No abstraction 3rd party).
* Hybrid-cloud: Public and Private clouds. Ideally from same vendor in order to have the same, seamless experience and featureset.
* Hybrid Cloud is *NOT* public cloud + legacy on-prems -> This is hybrid environment.
