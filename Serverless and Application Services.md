# Key Notes

## Event-driven Architecture 
* No constant running or waiting for things. 
* Producers generate events when something happen. 
* Events are delivered to consumers. 
* Actions are taken and the system returns to waiting. 
* Mature event-driven architecture only consumes resources while handling events.
